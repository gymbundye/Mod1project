        <p>Welcome to Movie Club Society! The place to be if you like to enjoy movies of all kinds. Here at MCS we strive to provide a list of movies, from today and yesterday, that you might enjoy or might despise!  Every week we pick a movie watch it, discuss it and then rate it! Very very easy. 
            <p>Who are we? Just three old friends who have seen a lot of movies. We thought that we might as well document what we love or hated about each movie so as to pass that info on to people who might be in the mood for a little Movie Club!</p> 
        <p>Have you ever surfed one of those streaming services for hours and hours and nothing looks good? It feels like you can spend more time trying to pick out something to watch than you actually do enjoying your choice.  MCS helps to carry that burden a little bit. As a member you know that you  will always have at least one film to watch a week! So grab some popcorn, get comfy in your favorite movie spot and strap in for Movie Club Society!  </p>
